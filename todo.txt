- Short-term -------------------------------------------------------------------
[ ] Add a default collider to Backdrops and make them collision-testable
  - testActiveCollision() should become testObjectCollision()
[ ] Add game title param, show it during loading and debug overlays
[ ] Cross-browser testing
[x] Remove instance collection -- user should be managing their own data
[x] Rewrite paragraph text parser as it has issues (Paragraph.setTextContent())
[x] Background additions
  [x] U/V Scroller
  [x] 9-patches
  [x] Iron out bugs
[/] Look through and take care of TODOs
[x] Test scaling
[x] Test Active.angleLookAtPoint()
[x] Mouse input
[x] Collisions
[x] Verify that origin point and collider are being drawn at the right positions
[x] Ensure that the 1-pixel sprite flip offset from Love2D doesn't happen here
[x] Remaining debug graphics
    factor?
    the correct position when resuming it? Perhaps multiplying by the pitch
[x] The pitch appears to change the time offset of a track... can we calculate
    fading-in song
[x] Check crossfades... the fading-out song seems to fade quicker than the

- Long-term --------------------------------------------------------------------
[ ] General cleanup and organization
[ ] Function comments
[ ] Function validation
[ ] Docs & tutorials

- Ponderings -------------------------------------------------------------------
[ ] Should we halt game logic when the fade delay of a room transition is hit?

- Outstanding Bugs -------------------------------------------------------------
[x] Backdrop: Shifting the UV, and then scaling it, will cause it to move
[ ] Make it so that, when clicking back into the screen when it's idle, the
    click event does not pass through (and click buttons, etc.)
[ ] Ensure the inactive pause screen text can fit most reasonable sizes
  - Will need a smaller font for very tiny resolutions
