- Short-term -------------------------------------------------------------------
[x] Check crossfades... the fading-out song seems to fade quicker than the
    fading-in song
[x] The pitch appears to change the time offset of a track... can we calculate
    the correct position when resuming it? Perhaps multiplying by the pitch
    factor?
[x] Remaining debug graphics
[x] Ensure that the 1-pixel sprite flip offset from Love2D doesn't happen here
[x] Verify that origin point and collider are being drawn at the right positions
[x] Collisions
[ ] Mouse input
[ ] Test Active.angleLookAtPoint()
[ ] Background 9-patches
[ ] Look through and take care of TODOs

- Long-term --------------------------------------------------------------------


- Ponderings -------------------------------------------------------------------
- Should we halt game logic when the fade delay of a room transition is hit?
