- Short-term -------------------------------------------------------------------
[x] Check crossfades... the fading-out song seems to fade quicker than the
    fading-in song
[x] The pitch appears to change the time offset of a track... can we calculate
    the correct position when resuming it? Perhaps multiplying by the pitch
    factor?
[x] Remaining debug graphics
[x] Ensure that the 1-pixel sprite flip offset from Love2D doesn't happen here
[x] Verify that origin point and collider are being drawn at the right positions
[x] Collisions
[x] Mouse input
[x] Test Active.angleLookAtPoint()
[x] Test scaling
[/] Look through and take care of TODOs
[ ] Background additions
  [x] U/V Scroller
  [ ] 9-patches
[ ] Rewrite paragraph text parser as it has issues (Paragraph.setTextContent())
[ ] Cross-browser testing

- Long-term --------------------------------------------------------------------


- Ponderings -------------------------------------------------------------------
- Should we halt game logic when the fade delay of a room transition is hit?
